# Daily SQL Challenge â€” Phanie & Kak Fathia

Gue bingung harus mulai nulis darimana...

But... WELCOME! This repository documents a structured daily SQL challenge completed by Kak Fathia & I (Phanie).
Each day, we both will solve the same SQL problem independently and then compare our solutions to learn different query approaches and optimization techniques.

Pray for us to keep being consistent (pretty please...) lmao.

## Overview

**Objective:**  
To build consistent SQL problem-solving habits, improve query efficiency, and enhance understanding of relational data operations through daily challenges.
